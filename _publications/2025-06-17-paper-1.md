**Abstract:**

Emotion recognition based on electroencephalogram (EEG) is fundamentally associated with human-like intelligence system. However, due to the noise-sensitive characteristics of EEGs and the individual variability of emotions, it is very challenging to extract inherent emotion dependent patterns from emotional EEG signals. In this work, we propose a L1-norm space defined discriminative brain network manifold learning model (L1-SGL), in which the EEG noise outliers can be effectively separated and the pseudolabeled samples caused by subjective feelings can be automatically corrected. Off-line experimental results consistently indicate that the L1-SGL can effectively suppress the influence of noise and achieve an incomparable superiority performance over other existing methods in EEG emotion recognition. Besides, benefiting from the time efficiency of the L1-SGL, an online emotion monitoring and regulation system is further implemented in this work. On-line emotion decoding experimental results (86.30%) of 25 participants prove that the L1-SGL can effectively satisfy the real-time requirements of on-line emotional monitoring applications, and the significant negative emotion regulation experimental results ( p<0.001 ) further confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of L1-SGL model in real-time emotion regulation and interactive applications. Overall, the L1-SGL provides a promising solution for the real-time online affective brain-computer interfaces (aBCIs) and the intelligent clinical closed-loop treatments.
