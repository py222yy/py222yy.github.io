  IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing. 

  We propose a time-aware sampling network (TAS-Net) using deep reinforcement learning, which is able to detect key emotion fragments and disregard irrelevant parts.

  IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems. 

  We propose a graph learning system inspired by the brain cognitive mechanism to automatically learn graph patterns and improve the performance of EEG emotion recognition.
