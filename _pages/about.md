# **About Me**

I am a currently graduate student at [school of life science and technology](https://www.life.uestc.edu.cn/), University of Electronic Science and Technology of China ([UESTC](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/)), under the supervision of Prof. [Peng Xu](https://www.life.uestc.edu.cn/sznr2.jsp?urltype=news.NewsContentUrl&wbtreeid=1221&wbnewsid=3559).
My research interest includes machine learning, deep learning and transfer learning for physiological signal. I am currently seeking **2026 PhD opportunities** in related fields.

In addition to AI for physiological signals, I am also interested in large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal research. Recently, I have been continuously learning technologies related to LLMs and multimodal methods, hoping to apply these advanced technologies to  physiological signals.

You can find my CV here: [Yue Pan's Curriculum Vitae](https://py222yy.github.io/cv/).
