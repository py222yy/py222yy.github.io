I am a currently graduate student at [school of life science and technology](https://www.life.uestc.edu.cn/), University of Electronic Science and Technology of China ([UESTC](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/)), under the supervision of Prof. [Peng Xu](https://www.life.uestc.edu.cn/sznr2.jsp?urltype=news.NewsContentUrl&wbtreeid=1221&wbnewsid=3559).

# **Publications**
- **Unsupervised Time-Aware Sampling Network with Deep Reinforcement Learning for EEG-Based Emotion Recognition**.

  Yongtao Zhang, **Yue Pan**, Yulin Zhang, Min Zhang, Linling Li, Li Zhang, Gan Huang, Lei Su, Honghai Liu, Zhen Liang, Zhiguo Zhang.

  We propose a time-aware sampling network (TAS-Net) using deep reinforcement learning, which is able to detect key emotion fragments and disregard irrelevant parts. 
- **An Efficient Graph Learning System for Emotion Recognition Inspired by the Cognitive Prior Graph of EEG Brain Network**.

  Cunbo Li, Tian Tang, Yue Pan, Lei Yang, Shuhan Zhang, Zhaojin Chen, Peiyang Li, Dongrui Gao, Huafu Chen, Fali Li, Dezhong Yao, Zehong Cao, Peng Xu.
